                <p>
                    JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
                    It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
                    (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
                    objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
                    them.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
                    Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
                    operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
                    be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
                    additional objects; for example:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                    For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
                    elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
                    clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
                    objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
                    server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
                    database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
                    another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
                    server.

                <p>
                    JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
                    different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
                    does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
                    JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
                    and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
                    renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                    declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                    number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
                    values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
                    more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
                    provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
                    for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
                    any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
                    objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                    have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
                    to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
                    protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
                    parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write
                your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>

                    greetMe("World");

                <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
                The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                </p>
                <p>
                A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
                dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
                Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
                "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
                (lowercase).
                </p>
                <p>
                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
                identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
                characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
                Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

                <article>
                <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                    generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This
                    syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See
                    Variable scope below.
                </p>
                </article>

            <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
                <header>Variable scope</header>
                <article>
                <p>
                    When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                    global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                    current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
                    is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                    function.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement
                    scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the
                    function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For
                    example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the
                    function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the
                    block, which in this case is an if statement.
                </p>
                <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
                <p>
                    This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in
                    ECMAScript 2015.
                </p>
        
                <code
                    >if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
                    not defined</code
                >
                </article>

            <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">

                <article>
                <p>
                    Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web
                    pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global
                    variables using the window.variable syntax.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window
                    or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or
                    frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is
                    declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an
                    iframe as parent.phoneNumber.

                <p>
                    You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword.
                    The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                    identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign
                    and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                </p>
        
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>
                    A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                    while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
                    scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
                    assumed to represent a variable.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                    variable in the same scope. For example:
                </p>
        
                <code
                    >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                    WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                    //statements }</code
                >
                However, object attributes are not protected, so the following
                statement is executed without problems.
                <code
                    >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                    "otherValue";</code

                <article>
                <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>
                        null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                        JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                        NULL, or any other variant.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                        undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                        </li>
                        <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                        <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>
                        Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                        are unique and immutable.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
        
                    <li>and Object</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
                    you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
                    functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
                    think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
                    procedures that your application can perform.</p>

            <section class="main-section" id="if...else_statement">
                <header>if...else statement</header>
                <article>
                <p>Use the if statement to execute a statement if a logical condition is
                    true. Use the optional else clause to execute a statement if the
                    condition is false. An if statement looks as follows:</p>
        
                <code>if (condition) { statement_1; } else { statement_2; }</code>
                condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. See
                Boolean for an explanation of what evaluates to true and false. If
                condition evaluates to true, statement_1 is executed; otherwise,
                statement_2 is executed. statement_1 and statement_2 can be any
                statement, including further nested if statements.
                <p>
                    You may also compound the statements using else if to have multiple
                    conditions tested in sequence, as follows:
                </p>
                <code
                    >if (condition_1) { statement_1; } else if (condition_2) {
                    statement_2; } else if (condition_n) { statement_n; } else {
                    statement_last; }
                </code>
                <p>In the case of multiple conditions only the first logical condition
                    which evaluates to true will be executed. To execute multiple
                    statements, group them within a block statement ({ ... }) . In
                    general, it's good practice to always use block statements, especially
                    when nesting if statements:</p>
        
                <code
                    >if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                    statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                    statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                    statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }</code
                >
                <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional
                    expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when
                    glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
                <code>if (x = y) { /* statements here */ }</code> 
                <p>If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to put
                    additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:</p>
        
                <code>if ((x = y)) { /* statements here */ }</code>

                <article>
                <p>A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
                    condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:</p>
        
                <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
                false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
                the statement following the loop.
        
                <p>
                    The condition test occurs before statement in the loop is executed.
                    If the condition returns true, statement is executed and the
                    condition is tested again. If the condition returns false, execution
                    stops and control is passed to the statement following while.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    To execute multiple statements, use a block statement ({ ... }) to
                    group those statements.
                </p>
        
                <p>Example:</p>
        
                <p>
                    The following while loop iterates as long as n is less than three:
                </p>
        
                <code>var n = 0; var x = 0; while (n &lt; 3) { n++; x += n; }</code>
                <p>
                    With each iteration, the loop increments n and adds that value to x.
                    Therefore, x and n take on the following values:
                </p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>After the first pass: n = 1 and x = 1</li>
                    <li>After the second pass: n = 2 and x = 3</li>
                    <li>After the third pass: n = 3 and x = 6</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    After completing the third pass, the condition n &lt; 3 is no longer
                    true, so the loop terminates.
                </p>

                <header>Function declarations</header>
                <article>
                <p>A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
                    statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
        
                <ul>
                    <li>The name of the function.</li>
                    <li>
                    A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
                    separated by commas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
                    curly brackets, { }.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    For example, the following code defines a simple function named
                    square:
                </p>
        
                <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
                <p>
                    The function square takes one argument, called number. The function
                    consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the
                    function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return
                    statement specifies the value returned by the function.
                </p>
                <code>return number * number;</code>
                <p>
                    Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by
                    value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function
                    changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected
                    globally or in the calling function.
